# Corner-Grocer
program that track grocery items

analyzes a list of grocery purchases from a text file and counts the frequency. menu option will allow you to choose a single item, all items, histogram, and exit.

making this program output the info was relatively easy but having it located where the file was a pain and now realize to make sure to track it whereever it is exactly then relatively where it is by name.

this program is easy to read with multiple spaces and comments left to explain whats going on and easy to add new code to it.

MAPS will be useful moving forward. 

other than the files being located all of this was very similar to other languages and easy to understand what needs to be outputed and ran with loops.
